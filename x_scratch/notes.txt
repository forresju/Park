Windows:
-- Must use Python 3
-- Must pip install as administrator.
-- Shapely depends on GEOS. The following steps will install the required geos libraries:
   1. Install Wheel (if not installed): pip install wheel
   2. Uninstall Shapely (if installed): pip uninstall Shapely
   3. Download the appropriate wheel (based on Python version) into the Park directory from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely
   4. Install the .whl file: pip install Shapely-1.6.4.post2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
-- Watch your directory structure!
-- Make sure all packages work with TensorFlow 1.5. Do not use TensorFlow 2.0 (e.g., TensorFlow 1.15 and Keras 2.2.5)
-- Commit without COCo dataset. Ignore all .h5 files in .gitignore
-- May have to pip install scikit-learn
-- FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS: https://www.hackeradam.com/installing-opencv-4-on-windows-10/
   Double check cmake python configuration from here: https://github.com/abidrahmank/OpenCV2-Python-Tutorials/blob/master/source/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.rst
   REMEMBER TO SET OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON
-- Make sure C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\cv2 exists after Install build
-- Database
Each Zone has one ZoneType
Each Zone belongs in one Lot
Each Zone is covvered by one Camera

Tutorial
-- Make sure to .gitignore Mask_RCNN folder and any datasets
-- Steps:
-- Check that cron, Python, Pip, and SQLite are installed:
whereis -b crontab | cut -d' ' -f2 | xargs rpm -qf
python3 --version
pip3 --version
sqlite3 -version
-- Clone Park into folder
cd Park
-- Clone Mask_RCNN into folder
cd Mask_RCNN
vi requirements.txt
Change:
tensorflow>=1.3.0,<2.0
keras>=2.0.8,<2.3
-- Follow directions or replace pip3 with:
yum -y install $(requirements.txt)
-- Continue to follow directions
-- DON"T FORGET pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
-- whereis python3
-- Change shebangs to location, i.e., #!/usr/bin/python3
-- Try appending "--user" instead of sudo next time or using "su park -c" before commands. May not work with chmod
sudo chmod 755 demo1.py
Must use Gnome or a GUI to run demos. OpenCV needs an x server, which you start by running "startx"
Must take ownership of folder in Gnome sudo chown -R $USER: $HOME
Change slashes to match Linux! Windows = "\\" and Linux = "/"

Must "sudo yum install python3-tkinter" or you will get a matplotlib is currently using a non-GUI backend ERROR

Pulling images from https works on Linux (e.g., Red Hat, CentOS, etc.), but not Windows due to FFMPEG being compiled without support for openssl

Use centroid intersects is better than intersects alone
