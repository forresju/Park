# Park!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As an intern at NASA Langley's OCIO, we worked on a lot of cool projects. Some of them involved machine learning, and, yes, this included a parking lot project with Georgia Tech. Due to multiple security requirements, the actual production system was a bit complex, but here is a simplified version of the application. It includes the full stack; SQL, Python, Linux scripts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, as well as cool computer vision and machine learning demos; feel free to use whatever you need or the whole thing if you like!</p>
<p>While the orginal system ran on three separate Red Hat Linux servers (i.e., scripts and back-end (Apache); front-end (Apache); and database (MySQL)), our system will run on a CentOS virtual machine using an Nginx HTTP Web Server and a MySQL database.</p>
