# Park!
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/park_demo.gif" alt="Welcome to Park!" /></div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As interns at NASA Langley, aka "The Sherpas", we worked on a lot of projects. Some of them involved machine learning, and, yes, this included a parking lot project with Georgia Tech. Due to architecture, security requirements, cross-lot tracking, etc., the NASA application was a bit complex, but here is a simplified version. It includes the full stack; SQL, Python, Linux scripts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, as well as cool computer vision and machine learning demos.</p>
<p>While the orginal system ran on three separate Red Hat Linux servers using Apache and MySQL, our demonstration system will run on the following system:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oracle VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM) Manager(using 6.0.6)</li>
    <li>CentOS Linux 7 (using 3.10.0-957.e17.x86_84)</li>
    <li>cron Time-Based Job Scheduler (using cronie-1.4.11-19.e17.x86_64)</li>
    <li>SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) (using 3.7.17)</li>
    <li>Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) (using epel-release-7-11.noarch)</li>
    <li>Nginx Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Web Server (using nginx.x86_64 1:1.16.1-1.e17)</li>
    <li>Python 3 Programming Language Interpreter (using version 3.6.8)</li>
    <li>PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (using version 5.4.16) with Zend Engine Interpreter (using version 2.4.0)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>As we just said, we'll be using CentOS Linux 7 in VirtualBox for this demo, but you can use another virtual machine or an actual server if you like. Just make sure that your system has at least 2GB of memory; 16GB of hard disk space; 128MB of video memory; and a connection to the Internet.</p>
<p>We'll be using the default minimal install option. Since our focus is on getting Park up and running, we won't get into creating a CentOS VM in VirtualBox. Several online walkthroughs exist: <a href="https://tutorials.kurtobando.com/install-a-centos-7-minimal-server-in-virtual-machine-with-screenshots/" title="Install a CentOS 7 Minimal Server in Virtual Machine with screenshots" target="_blank">Kurt Bando's tutorial</a> is an excellent walkthrough.</p>
<p>Once the VM is setup and to start things off right, let's create a super user to avoid using the root user:</p>
<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# adduser park
[root@localhost ~]# passwd park
Changing password for user park.
New password: ********
Retype new password: ********
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[root@localhost ~]# gpasswd -a park wheel
Adding user park to group wheel
[root@localhost ~]# su - park
[park@localhost ~]#
</pre>
<p>Next, update the system and add CentOS' development tools using the following commands:</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y update
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install yum-utils
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y groupinstall development
</pre>
<p>This may take a while, especially on a new system.</p>
<p>Once the system update is completed, make sure that we have everything we need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>cron Time-Based Job Scheduler</b> - cron should be already installed, but check anyway:
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# whereis -b crontab | cut -d' ' -f2 | xargs rpm -qf
cronie-1.4.11-19.e17.x86_64
</pre>
        <p>If cron is not installed, install it using the following command:</p>
<pre>[park@localhost ~]# yum -y install cronie</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>SQLite RDBMS</b> - SQLite should also be installed, but check anyway:
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sqlite3 -version
3.7.17 2013-05-20 00:56:22 118a3b35693b134d56ebd780123b7fd6f1497668
</pre>
        <p>If SQLite is not installed, install it using the following command:</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install sqlite
</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Nginx HTTP Web Server</b> - To use Nginx, install the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" title="Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)" target="_blank">Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)</a> first:
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install epel-release
</pre>
        <p>Once the installation is completed, install Nginx:</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install nginx
</pre>
        <p>Once Nginx is installed, start the server. In addition, run the second command so that Nginx automatically starts when the system boots up:</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo systemctl start nginx
[park@localhost ~]# sudo systemctl enable nginx
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.
</pre>
        <p>Once the server is started, we have several ways to access the web server:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Method #1: Open a browser in the VM - This is the easiest way, but we won't be able to access the site remotely. Install and start a desktop GUI, such as GNOME, using the following commands:
<pre>
sudo yum -y groupinstall "GNOME Desktop"
sudo startx
</pre>
            <p>Once the desktop appears, open a browser and navigate to localhost (http://127.0.0.1) and the Welcome page should appear:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme01.png" alt="localhost on GNOME" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
            </li>
            <li>Method #2: Access the web server through the VM host's browser - This method allows us to "test" the web server over a an actual connection, even though everything occurs on the VM's host computer.
            <p>First, shutdown the VM and access the network settings:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme02.png" alt="VirtualBox Network Settings 1" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
            <p>Click on <b>Port Forwarding</b>. Set the Host Port to 8080 and the Guest Port to 80; click on <b>OK</b> when you are done:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme03.png" alt="VirtualBox Network Settings 2" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
            <p>Restart the VM and enter the following commands:</p>
<pre>
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
</pre>
            <p>Open a browser on the host machine, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080, and the Welcome page should appear:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme05.png" alt="localhost on Host" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
            </li>
            <li>Method #3: If you are using an actual server, you can access it by entering its public IP address. Pull up the network interfaces using the following command:
<pre>ip addr</pre>
            <p>The first network interface name should be localhost, while the following name, which has the attributes &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt;, should be the name of the public address. Navigate to the INET IP address in a browser, and the Welcome page should appear.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>PHP Hypertext Preprocessor</b> - We'll be using PHP as the intermediary between the front and back ends. To install PHP, run the following command:
<pre>[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install php php-fpm</pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Python 3 Programming Language Interpreter</b> - While Python 2 is installed with CentOS by default, we will need Python 3 to run our computer vision and machine learning scripts, specically Python 3.6.x. There are a few ways of doing this, but we will use the IUS Community Repo; for an in-depth look at options, check out <a href="https://www.hogarthuk.com/?q=node/15" title="Running newer applications on CentOS" target="_blank">this link from James Hogarth</a>. To install Python, run the following command:
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install python36u
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install python36u-pip
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install python36u-devel
</pre>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Alright! Before continuing, let's do another update of the system using the following command:</p>
<pre>[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y update</pre>
<p>Just in case, we'll double check everything is installed and updated using the following commands:</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# whereis -b crontab | cut -d' ' -f2 | xargs rpm -qf
[park@localhost ~]# sqlite3 -version
[park@localhost ~]# nginx -v
[park@localhost ~]# php -v
[park@localhost ~]# python3 ––version
[park@localhost ~]# pip3 ––version
</pre>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme06.png" alt="Verifying initial setup" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
<p>One last thing: Using VirtualBox Guest Additions is not necessary, but it will make our life easier (e.g., cut and paste, etc.). Complete the following steps:
<p>With the VM running...</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on "Devices" on the VM menu bar</li>
<li>Click on the "Insert Guest Additions CD image..." option (If you get an error, you may have already inserted the disk).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the terminal, enter the following commands (comments following [#] are not required):</p>
<pre>
[park@localhost ~]# sudo yum -y install make gcc kernel-headers kernel-devel perl dkms bzip2 # Installs all requirements
[park@localhost ~]# export KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r) # set and export the location of the kernel source code
[park@localhost ~]# mount -r /dev/cdrom /media
[park@localhost ~]# cd /media/
[park@localhost ~]# ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
[park@localhost ~]# sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $(whoami)
</pre>
<p>We also recommend enabling shared folders. How to do so is out of our scope (our host machine is Windows, while you may be using something else). For Windows, we recommend <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-shared-folder-host-os-guest-os-virtual-box/" title="Create a Shared Folder between Host OS and Guest OS (Virtual Box)" target="_blank">this walkthrough from Geeks for Geeks.</a> Even though the directions are for Ubuntu, they will work for CentOS as well.</p>
<p>Whew! That was a lot of setting up! Now let's get to the data model...</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Data Model</h2>
<p>Our data model consists of five tables:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Zone</b> - How many cars are in each zone is the main unit of measurement for this application. This table contains the maximum number of parking spaces within a zone, as well as the boundaries of each zone within its associated "feed".</li>
<li><b>Source</b> - This table contains a list of the "feeds" that collect images of zones, as well as the feed location and credentials. The source's URI is a unique value.</li>
<li><b>Lot</b> - This table contains a list of all the parking lots being observed, as well as their centerpoint latitude and longitude. The lot name is a unique value.</li>
<li><b>Type</b> - This table contains a list of the types of parking zones (e.g., visitor, handicap, etc.). The type description is a unique value.</li>
<li><b>OccupancyLog</b> - This table is a junction table (i.e., an associative entity) that collects and timestamps all the zone counts, providing both current and historical parking data. In our application, the interval will be every 5 minutes, updated by the cron scheduler.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="README_images/readme07.png" alt="Park Data Model" style="height: 400px;" /></div>
<p>The relationships between the tables are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each Zone has only one Source, but a Source may observe one or many Zones.</li>
<li>Each Zone has only one Type, but a Type may apply to zero or many Zones.</li>
<li>Each Zone is located in only one Lot, but a Lot may contain one or many Zones.</li>
<li>Each Occupancy Log entry lists one Zone, but a Zone may appear in zero to many Occupancy Log entries.</li>
<li>Each Occupancy Log entry lists one Type, but a Type may appear in zero to many Occupancy Log entries.</li>
<li>Each Occupancy Log entry lists one Lot, but a Lot may appear in zero to many Occupancy Log entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Zone table has a unique constraint, consisting of its ID, a SourceID, a LotID, and a TypeID. The OccupancyLog table also has a unique constraint, consisting of its timestamp, a ZoneID, a LotID, and a TypeID.</p>
<p>Now its time to run our first script. A few words of caution:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3><em>Watch your line endings if switching between OS's!</em></h3></li>
<li><h3><em>Make sure you stick with either tabs or spaces!</em></h3></li>
</ul>
